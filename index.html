                        <strong>Welcome to Cyber-Quiz Challenge:</strong> <br>
                        Before you begin, make sure you're in a distraction-free environment. Grab a pen and paper if you prefer to jot down notes. The quiz consists of multiple-choice questions, 
                        so choose the best option that fits the question. Let's get started!
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Timing and Progress:</strong> <br>
                        You will have the opportunity to re-select an option if your initial choice is incorrect. Upon making a selection,
                        the system will indicate whether the answer is right or wrong. If the answer is wrong, a message will be displayed,
                        informing you of the correct answer in a clear paragraph format. Progress will be tracked and shown at the bottom of
                        the page just after the last question option. Please double-check your responses before proceeding to the next question.
                        
                        We encourage you to take note of the questions you missed, as this system is designed to help you learn and improve more
                        effectively.
